# PFTC7-2023
This repository contains:
  A data folder containing all licor and Excel files generated during PFTC7.
  A code folder containing functions based on the Fast Assimilation-Temperature Response (FAsTeR) method (Garen and Michaletz 2024).
  A main analysis file called CleanData.CreateMainFile.R. This file cleans and organizes the datasets.
  A Figures.Rmd file that generates all figures 
  Files to be ignored: .gitignore and .DS_Store

  To run this code: 
    1. Clone repository to personal device.
    2. Open CleanData.CreateMainFile.R and run this file (set working directory to PFTC7-2023 folder).
    3. This will generate results2.csv which is the cleaned and complete data file.
    4. Now, the Figures.Rmd file can be run and figures generated. 
    5. You should never edit the code folder nor the data folder.
